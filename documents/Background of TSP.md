# Background:

Travelling Salesman Problem refers to finding the shortest route that visits each city exactly once, given a set of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, and returns to the starting city. Solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is important because it has numerous real-world applications and can lead to significant cost savings and efficiency improvements in various industries. Even without any transformation, the original form of the travelling salesman problem can be directly applied to scenarios such as route planning, logistics, chip circuit design, etc., and can be used to solve sub-problems such as DNA sequencing with minor changes. Therefore The travelling salesman problem is one of the most studied problems in the field of optimization.
Moreover, the TSP is a fundamental problem in the field of optimization theory and Many optimization algorithms have been developed specifically to solve the TSP, and advancements in solving this problem have led to advancements in other areas of optimization and computer science. 
In summary, solving the TSP has both practical and theoretical significance, and advancements in solving this problem can have far-reaching implications in various fields.
Implications in various fields:1. In logistics and transportation, finding the shortest possible route to visit a set of locations can help reduce fuel costs, travel time, and vehicle wear and tear. In 1952, Danzig, Fulkerson and Johnson successfully solved the TSP instances of 48 cities in different states of the continental United States and 49 cities in the District of Columbia3. Optimise the routing of data packets in computer networks, leading to faster and more reliable communication.4. Serves as a benchmark for testing the performance of optimization algorithms. 
Ways of solving Travelling Salesman Problem:1. Traditional method:Bruteforce: Examining every possible permutation of each node and calculating total distance for each permutation.Greedy Algorithms: Make locally optimal choices at each step, not guranteed for global optimal solution.2. Dynamic programming: Breaking it down into smaller subproblems, the most well-known dynamic programming algorithm for TSP is Bellman-Held-Karp algorithm.3. Biological solutions:Using unicellular amoeboids to solve this issue[1].
